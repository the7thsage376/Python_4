# File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️

## Overview
This program reads a file, processes its content, and writes the modified version to a new file. It also includes error handling to gracefully manage file-related issues.

## Features
- Reads content from a user-specified file.
- Modifies the content based on predefined processing logic.
- Writes the modified text to a new file.
- Handles errors such as file not found or unreadable files.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the filename of the source file.
3. The program processes the text and saves the result in a new file.
4. If the file is missing or cannot be read, appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Error Handling Lab 🧪
- The program prompts the user for a filename.
- If the file does not exist or cannot be read, an error message is shown, preventing crashes.
- Ensures smooth execution and guides the user to provide a valid file.

## Outcomes 🎉
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain hands-on experience with file handling in Python.
- Understand how to implement robust error handling for real-world applications.
- Develop clean and structured code that enhances user experience.
